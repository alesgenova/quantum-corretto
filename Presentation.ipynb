    "embedded Quantum ESPRESSO is a fast and capable software, but it's also written with poor coding standards. Thus developing and extending the codebase is extremely painful and prone to errors (trust him, he wrote it).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason why the situation is so dire, is that eQE is entangled with the Quantum Espresso (QE) code, and QE happens to have huge flaws in the way it is written.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we believe is the worst problem is that QE is not compliant to <i>functional paradigm</i> standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "A function provided the same inputs should always return the same output.\n",
